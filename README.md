# text-classification
A predictive model that can identify the class of medical condition, with high precision, from a given medical abstract. Keywords: Text pre-processing, kNN, F1 scoring metric for evaluation.

Medical abstracts describe the current conditions of a patient. Doctors routinely scan dozens or hundreds of abstracts each day as they do their rounds in a hospital and must quickly pick up on the salient information pointing to the patientâ€™s malady. You are trying to design assistive technology that can identify, with high precision, the class of problems described in the abstract. In the given dataset, abstracts from 5 different conditions have been included: digestive system diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, nervous system diseases, and general pathological conditions.

The goal is to develop predictive models that can determine, given a particular medical abstract, which one of 5 classes it belongs to. For this, I have implemented min-epsilon k-NN classifier.
